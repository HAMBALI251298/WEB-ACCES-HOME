# WEB-BACCES-HOME-BANK
Bank is a light-weight core banking application that powers banking operations like account creation, customer deposit and withdrawals. This application only supports a single bank, where users can sign up and create bank accounts online, but must visit one of the bank's branches to withdraw or deposit money.
